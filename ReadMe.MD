project contents

1. This is a game project that is made by using opengles2.0 in android which goal is to stack as many blocks as the player can.

2. At start a cube shaped block that has wide base area and short height is given. 

3. A cube shaped block that the base has the same width and length as that of the uppermost block moves back and forth above the uppermost block in direction of east <-> west or north <-> south.

4. When the player touches the screen the block is stacked above the uppermost block.

5. If the block that is stacked doesn’t fit in the lower floor block, the part of the block that does not lie on the lower floor block is cut off.

6. Next turn the newly stacked block becomes the uppermost block and a new block that has the same base as that of uppermost block has to be stacked on to it.

7. The procedure would continue the project contents 3 ~ 6.

8. There is a rotation button on the screen that when the player touches the button the block that should be stacked would rotate 90˚ about y-axis in counter clockwise.

9. The view direction is fixed to the uppermost block and the player can see only see up to 5 blocks from top.

10. The defeat is determined only when the newly stacked block doesn’t fully lie on the uppermost block.
